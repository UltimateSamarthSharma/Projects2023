For example, if you are classifying images of handwritten digits, you might know that the digits are often written in a way that makes them appear more similar to their neighboring digits. In this case, a smaller value of K might be more appropriate.\n",

This phenomenon can be problematic for KNN algorithm, as it relies heavily on the notion of distance between data points.\n",

    "In high-dimensional spaces, the number of possible features or dimensions increases exponentially, leading to a sparsity of data, where the training data becomes insufficient to accurately estimate the distances between data points. As the number of dimensions increases, the distances between the nearest neighbors tend to become increasingly similar, making it harder to find the K-nearest neighbors and affecting the accuracy of the KNN algorithm.\n",

In addition, other algorithms that are less affected by the curse of dimensionality, such as decision trees or neural networks, can be used as alternatives to KNN in high-dimensional spaces."
