    "Ordinal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable based on its order or rank.

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. This technique is particularly useful when there is a strong relationship between the target variable and the categorical variable. The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are:\n",
    "1. Group the categories of the categorical variable by their target mean.\n",
    "2. Order the categories in ascending or descending order based on their target mean.\n",
    "3. Assign a numerical value to each category based on the ordered sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, let's say we have a categorical variable called \"occupation\" with the following categories: \"doctor,\" \"lawyer,\" \"engineer,\" \"teacher,\" \"salesperson,\" and \"clerk.\" We want to predict whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year, which is our target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can group the categories of \"occupation\" by their mean target value (i.e., the proportion of people who earn more than $50,000 per year for each category) as follows:\n",
    "1. Doctor: 0.8\n",
    "2. Lawyer: 0.7\n",

    "4. Teacher: 0.4\n",
    "5. Salesperson: 0.3\n",
    "6. Clerk: 0.2\n",

    "3. Engineer: 3\n",
    "4. Teacher: 4\n",
    "5. Salesperson: 5\n",
    "6. Clerk: 6\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a strong relationship between the target variable and the categorical variable, as it can help capture this relationship in the encoded variable. This can improve the predictive power of a machine learning model by providing a more informative input variable."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two random variables. Specifically, it measures how much two variables vary together, meaning how much the values of one variable change when the values of the other variable change. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides a way to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This relationship can be used to better understand the underlying data and can help in modeling and prediction. For example, in finance, the covariance between two stocks can be used to construct a diversified portfolio that minimizes risk. In machine learning, covariance is used in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to find the most important features or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the covariance between two variables X and Y is: **cov(X, Y) = E[(X - μX) * (Y - μY)]**\n",

    "**Where E[] represents the expected value or mean, μX and μY are the means of X and Y, and * represents multiplication.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Where Σ represents the sum, xi and yi are the individual observations of X and Y, μX and μY are the sample means of X and Y, and n is the sample size.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the magnitude of the covariance depends on the units of measurement of the two variables. Therefore, it is common to normalize the covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y. This normalized version is called the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1 and is unitless."
