    "R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is a commonly used metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the explained variance (sum of squared deviations of the predicted values from the mean of the dependent variable) by the total variance (sum of squared deviations of the actual values from the mean of the dependent variable). The resulting value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, R-squared can be calculated as:<br>**R2 = 1 - (SSres / SStot)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values) and SStot is the total sum of squares (the deviation of each actual value from the mean of the dependent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is interpreted as the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. For example, if R-squared is 0.75, it means that 75% of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. The remaining 25% of the variability is due to other factors not accounted for in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R-squared does not indicate the causal relationship between the independent and dependent variables, nor does it indicate the accuracy or reliability of the model. Therefore, R-squared should be used in conjunction with other measures to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model."

Tuning these hyperparameters can be time-consuming and requires cross-validation, which can add computational overhead.\n",
