    "Feature selection plays an important role in anomaly detection because it helps to identify the most relevant features that can distinguish between normal and anomalous data. Anomalies are data points that differ significantly from the majority of data points in a dataset, and they may be caused by various factors such as errors in data collection, fraud, or unusual events.\n",

    "2. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: FPR measures the proportion of normal data points that are incorrectly identified as anomalies by the algorithm. It is calculated as FPR = FP / (FP + TN), where FP is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives.\n",
    "3. **Precision**: Precision measures the proportion of identified anomalies that are actually anomalies. It is calculated as Precision = TP / (TP + FP).\n",

The higher the AUROC score, the better the algorithm is at distinguishing between normal and anomalous data.\n",

The **minPts** parameter is an important hyperparameter that controls the minimum cluster size.\n",

This parameter is critical in determining the performance of DBSCAN in detecting anomalies, as anomalies are typically data points that are located in low-density regions of the dataset.\n",

One approach is to use a grid search or cross-validation to find the optimal epsilon value based on a performance metric such as F1-score or AUROC. Another approach is to use domain knowledge or prior information to select a reasonable range of epsilon values that are likely to contain the anomalies, and then evaluate the algorithm's performance with different values within that range."
