Still, he has no idea how the speed is increased by pressing the accelerators, nor does he understand the car's inner mechanism or how the accelerator, brakes, and other controls are implemented. This is precisely what Abstraction is."

    "The literal meaning of the word abstract is things that summarize or concentrate the essentials of a bigger thing or several things. In the Abstraction process, we try and obtain an abstract view, model, or structure of a true-life problem and reduce its unnecessary details. With definition of properties of problems, including the info which are affected and therefore the operations which are identified, the model abstracted from problems may be a customary solution to the present kind of problems. It's an efficient way since there are nebulous real-life problems that have similar properties. In simple terms, it's hiding the unnecessary details & showing only the essential parts/functionalities to the user.\n",

    "For example, you have all the info of citizens of a country like their name, age, gender, favorite movie, favorite food, etc. You're asked to arrange a chart mentioning the total number of females, males, age, and full name. During this case, you merely need three data, and the rest all the information doesn't seem to be of any use. So, this process of choosing useful data and hiding unwanted data is abstraction."

    "Encapsulation is a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users. Encapsulation is the process of mixing data and functions into one single unit called class. In Encapsulation, one cannot access the information directly; it can only be accessed using the functions present within the class. In simple words, attributes of the class are kept private, and public getter and setter methods are provided to govern these attributes. Encapsulation makes the concept of knowledge hiding possible. In simple terms, encapsulation offers a protective shield around the data, and therefore, the code which doesn't allow random access of code outside the shield.\n",

    "In Python, abstract base classes (abc module) provide a blueprint for concrete classes. They don’t contain implementation. Instead, they provide an interface and make sure that derived concrete classes are properly implemented. Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated. Instead, they are inherited and extended by the concrete subclasses. Also, their subclasses are derived from a specific abstract base class must implement the methods and properties provided in that abstract base class. The main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test whether an object adheres to a given specification. It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesn’t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance."

When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract, which includes some abstract methods. Also, we can't create an object of an abstract class. But we can create a reference variable of an abstract class. The reference variable is used to refer to the objects of derived classes, that is, subclasses of an abstract class."
